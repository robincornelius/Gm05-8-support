Linux Instructions

Last tested 2/2/2023 on Debian Linux Bullseye

1) Grab the build tools and required dependencies

	sudo apt-get install build-essental autotools automake autotools-dev autoconf m4 libtool
	sudo apt-get install libusb libusb-dev

2) Rerun the auto tools generator, from inside the gaussmeter source code run

	autoreconf -i -f
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

by default this will build the library and example using the library and install in to /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/bin shared 
and static lins are built.

3) Testing

Depending on your setup it may be necessary to tell the system where the library is, if you installed by default in to /usr/local/lib
then please first set LD_LIBRRY_PATH

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
	/usr/local/bin/consoleexample

Select USB or serial port and allow to connect to gaussmeter, a menu is shown and demonstrates all the API functions
